# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis (Telecom Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a telecom company to understand
why customers leave (churn) and identify patterns associated with churn behavior.
The project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer churn distribution
- Analyze key factors influencing churn
- Perform exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical features
- Prepare data for machine learning modeling
- Build a basic churn prediction model

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**, which includes:
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Service usage details
- Contract and payment information
- Churn status (Target Variable)

Target Column:
- `Churn` (Yes / No)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analysis performed:
- Churn distribution analysis
- Tenure vs churn comparison
- Monthly charges vs churn analysis
- Contract type and payment method impact on churn
- Correlation analysis between numerical features

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- Problem Type: **Classification**
- Model Used: **Logistic Regression**
- Data preprocessing:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Train-test split
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn
- Customer churn is influenced by multiple factors, not a single variable

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for customer churn analysis,
from data understanding and EDA to building a basic predictive model.
The insights gained can help businesses improve customer retention strategies.
